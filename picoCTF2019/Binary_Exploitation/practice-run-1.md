## Description:
> You're going to need to know how to run programs if you're going to get out of here. Navigate to /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e on the shell server and run this program to receive a flag.

## Hint:
> How do you execute a program in a command line?

## Solving:

Once logged in to the pico shell and navigating to the directory provided we find a program called run-this. 
We run it using the following command and grep our flag.
```c
./run_this | grep -oE 'picoCTF{.*?}'
picoCTF{g3t_r3adY_2_r3v3r53}

```
### Flag: 

```c
picoCTF{g3t_r3adY_2_r3v3r53}

```
