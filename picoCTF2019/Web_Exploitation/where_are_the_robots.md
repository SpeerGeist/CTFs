## Description:
> Can you find the robots? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/45102/

## Hint:
> What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solving:

With the challenge title in mind, I looked for the robots.txt file in ...problem/45102/robots.txt and found:
```c
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8e32f.html
```
If we go to ...problem/54102/8e32f.html we find the flag:

### Flag: 

```c
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8e32f}
```
