# Open-to-admins - 200 points
Web_Exploitation

## Description:
> This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12276/

## Hint:
> Can cookies help you to get the flag?

## Solving:

This challenge is very much like logon. We have a flag button that will reveal when the session parameters admin = True and time = 1400. So if we create two new cookie parameters in the console with these and then click the flag button the flag is revealed.

### Flag: 

```c
Flag: picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_dcb566bb}
```
