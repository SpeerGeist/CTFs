# logon - 100 points
Web_Exploitation

## Description:
> The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47307/

## Hint:
> Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?

## Solving:

After opening up the page you are presented with a log in form. I naturally tried 'admin' 'admin' and got a successful log in with no flag. I checked the cookies in the browser console and noticed an admin = False parameter. After changing this to 'True' and refreshing the page, the flag was presented.

### Flag: 

```c

```
