## Description:
> There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37868/ Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hint:
> There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
> Try to think about how does the website verify your login?

## Solving:

When accessing the link there is a menu to an Admin log in page. After trying admin | admin unsuccessfully I tried a simple SQL injection using 
```c
' or 1=1 --
```
The flag was then presented after a successful log in.

### Flag: 

```c
picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_a57b0b1d}
```
