## Description:
> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/61676/

## Hint:
> How do you inspect web code on a browser? There's 3 parts.

## Solving:

On the 'How' page of the site it picks out the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of the site. If we look at the source on those 3 things we get each part of the flag:
```c
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?1638dbe7} */
```
### Flag: 

```c
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?1638dbe7}
```
